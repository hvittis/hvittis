- 👋 Hi, I’m @hvittis
- 👀 I’m interested in C/C++, Qt, QML, GNSS, agriculture, ISO11783, IEC, Codesys, IoT, data dashboards, Linux... too many things in general :D
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to integrate interesting pieces together
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects on interesting topics.
- 📫 How to reach me... Well, we'll see if there's a way through github. If not, I'll drop my contacts here in future
